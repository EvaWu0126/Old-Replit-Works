  <p class="mond-story"> This is the first nation Traveler stepped foot on in the world of Tevyat. After waking up, Paimon decided to lead the way to the closest city nearby-- Mondstadt. After touching the Statue of Anemo, the Traveler received the power of anemo, and they spotted a huge green dragon flying through the sky. 
  <br>
  Upon chasing, Paimon and Traveler spotted both the dragon and a stranger who tried to comfort the huge dragon. But the newfound power of the Traveler alerted the dragon, and the stranger also fled away. Not long after they arrived at the City of Mondstadt, the green dragon they had sighted, called “Stormterror" by the locals, started to attack the city and formed huge storms.
